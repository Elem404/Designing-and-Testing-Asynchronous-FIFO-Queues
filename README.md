# Designing and Testing Asynchronous FIFO Queues
The code presented in this repository was part of a paper written for the course "Metastability-Containing Hardware" which is taught by Dr. Moti Medina within the Faculty of Engineering at Bar Ilan University

This repository contains source files in VHDL language for the following systems:
- Sequence generator (8 bit) + TB
- Batcher's Odd-Even Sort Network + TB
- Asynchronous FIFO Queues + TB
- Full system integration + TB
